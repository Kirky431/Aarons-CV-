    <h1>hobbies</h1>
    <p>I joined Hensingham Rugby Club for under 16s and i started developing my rugby skills and fitness to develop my skills.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of Moor Row Football Club since 2016 working through the football years developing my skills which I fully enjoy. I trained 2 Nights a week and part of a football match every weekend.</p>
    <p>We have 2 working cocker spaniels which I look after with my family and love walking and playing with them when we go out into the fells at the weekends.</p>
    <p>I was a member of Hensingham Scouts for 3 years and liked being part of the scouts' team until other commitments with football took over.</p>
    <p>I also love going to the gym and focusing on self-development and inspire to become the best version of myself and because of this developed self-discipline because it's not like I want to go every day, but I know it's for the greater good.</p>
    <p>In my free time i love coding making websites and webpages even games and apps</p>
