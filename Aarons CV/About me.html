    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr>
    <P>I am a 16-year-old student who undertook a work placement in July 2022 at Home Group within the Maintenance team. I am an exceptionally reliable, friendly, kind, and caring person who likes to work hard and give the best in everything I do. I have a very keen interest in Maths, Science, Engineering and Computer Science and I achieved satisfactory results in all my tests and assignments projected to pass all GCSEs at mocks stage. I have also been working at McDonalds and have gained many skills such as communication, problem solving, and confidence which gives me more qualifications that make me a great team member or leader.</P>
    <p>I am currently undertaking a T Level in Digital Support services and I am hoping to gain a future career in cyber security after this course.</p>
    <p>I am a determined individual and keen to use what I have learnt in my experiences in school, Scouts and Football team which has taught me to always try hard and achieve.</p>
